I am a Earth researcher in the JIFRESSE at the University of California, Los Angeles. My research fields are in environmental and atmospheric sciences. I received a BS and MS in Environmental Sciences from Peking University, China, and a PhD in Atmospheric Sciences from Texas A&M University.

My research centers on environmental, climatic, and health effects of air pollution, particularly for aerosol particles emitted from anthropogenic sources. Currently, I focus on modeling studies of aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions, experimentally and theoretically investigation on aerosol clustering and formation, laboratory monitoring and characterizing air pollutants' emissions, and statistically and systematically research on miscellaneous effects of human activities on environment.
