I am a researcher in the JIFRESSE at the University of California, Los Angeles. My research fields are in environmental and atmospheric sciences. I received a BS and MS in Environmental Sciences from Peking University, China, and a PhD in Atmospheric Sciences from the University of Texas A&M.

My research interests are 
- Aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions using regional-scale models;
- Experimental and theoretical study of aerosol clustering and formation;
- Laboratory measurements of air pollution emissions and characteristics.
