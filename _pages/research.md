## Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation interactions
I employ regional-scale models to simulate and investigate aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions under various meteorological conditions.
>Tools: aerosol-aware, cloud-permitting atmospheric models coupled with other components like chemistry, ocean, etc.;
>Systems: Tropical cyclones, severe convective clouds, orographic clouds, shallow cumulus.
>One of my recent work is urbanization impacts on severe storm with hazard weather [(Lin et al., 2020)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/aop/JAS-D-20-0106.1/JAS-D-20-0106.1.xml).

## Aerosol Clustering and Formation
I use both experimental and theoretical methods to reveal the roles of gaseous precusors or semi-volatile species in aerosol clustring and formation.
>Tools: chemical quantum calculations using Gaussain09; experimental study using flow tube-CIMS, smoke chamber, etc.;
>Chemical species: sulferic acid-organic acid-amin-ammonia, expocides, etc..

## Emissions and Characteristics of Air Pollutants
I use self-designed sampling or reaction experimental systems equiped with commercial monitoring devices or instruments to charaterize the emissions of air pollutants and their physical, chemical, and optial properties.
>Experimental systems and monitoring instruments: smoke chamber, smoke sampling and dilution system etc.;
>Pollutants: gaseous precusors, fine particles, black carbon, secondary organic compounds, etc..

## Miscellaneous Environmental Effects of Human Activities
I am working with other researchers to reveal other environmental effects of human activities, e.g., human health effect of air pollution, water-food-energy nexus, etc..
>Tools: statistical analysis, dynamic social-economic system, etc..
