## Pressure Enhancement in Adsorbed Films for Future High-Pressure Processing
I applied molecular simulations and statistical mechanics to understand the physics behind strong compression and the induced high pressure (as high as tens of thousands of bars) in adsorbed layers which would lead to [a ‘green’ route to the future high-pressure manufacturing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095809917308354). We are developing a new experimental route to estimate the in-layer effective tangential pressure which was found to be the main driving force for high pressure phenomena in pores. The goal of this project is to be able to design high-pressure chemical reactions or separation process that requires a fine control of the microscopic pressure. 




## Adsorption on Heterogeneous Surfaces
Most surfaces exhibit roughness through geometric curvature, variations of surface composition and chemical groups attached to the surfaces. We are developing advanced statistical mechanical models for the adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces. We are also exploring the possibilities of incorporating the developed theories into the software of the experimental instruments to predict the adsorption properties and to characterize the solid substrate.
