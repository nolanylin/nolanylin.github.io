## Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation interactions
I employ regional-scale models to simulate and investigate aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions under various meteorological conditions.
>Aerosol-aware, cloud-permitting atmospheric models coupled with other components like chemistry, ocean, and so on are used to eloborate the underlying physics of aerosol effcts on clouds and precipitation associated with various systems, for example, tropical cyclones, severe convective clouds, orographic clouds, shallow cumulus, etc..

>One of my recent work has evaluted the urbanization impacts on severe storm with hazard weather [(Lin et al., 2020)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/aop/JAS-D-20-0106.1/JAS-D-20-0106.1.xml):

## Aerosol Clustering and Formation
I use both experimental and theoretical methods to reveal the roles of gaseous precusors or semi-volatile species in aerosol clustring and formation.
>We conduct chemical quantum calculations using [Gaussian](https://gaussian.com/) to understand the multi-component clustering process when aerosol formation initialize. Experimentally, we employ instruments like flow tube-CIMS, smoke chamber and so on to mimic aerosol formation process in real atmosphere. Chemical species and stystem involved in aerosol formation include sulferic acid, organic acid, amin, expocides, SOA coating on BC core, etc..
>One of my recent work looks at the role of one of prevailing dicarboxylic acids in the atmosphere (i.e., succinic acid) in sulferic acid-amin-ammonia clustering system[(Lin et al., 2019)](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/19/8003/2019/):

## Emissions and Characteristics of Air Pollutants
Self-designed sampling or reaction experimental systems equiped with commercial monitoring devices or instruments are applied to charaterize the emissions of air pollutants and their physical, chemical, and optial properties.
>The experimental systems and monitoring instruments include smoke chamber, smoke sampling and dilution system etc.. The target pollutants under study invole gaseous precusors, fine particles, black carbon, secondary organic compounds, and so on.
>One of such our work has employed self-designed smoke diluting and sampling platform to mimic the emissios of open biomass burnings and their emission charateristics [(Zhang et al., 2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231012005407):

## Miscellaneous Environmental Effects of Human Activities
I am working with other researchers to reveal other environmental effects of human activities, e.g., human health effect of air pollution, water-food-energy nexus, etc..
>Tools: statistical analysis, dynamic social-economic system, etc..
