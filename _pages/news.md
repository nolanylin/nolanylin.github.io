## 2021
**March**
- My first-authored book chapter on the current advances in characterization of nano-porous materials just got published online and here is the link to the [full book](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-65991-2)! My chapter [[PDF]](http://kaihangshi.github.io/assets/docs/book/PorousMaterials_Chap12_2021.pdf) focuses particularly on characterization of pore size distribution and specific surface area of porous materials. Classical methods, modern molecular methods and those related to machine learning techniques are all discussed! 
- I was chosen as the winner for the [2020 James K. Ferrell Outstanding Ph.D. Graduate Award](https://www.cbe.ncsu.edu/graduate/graduate-student-awards/)! This award recognizes an outstanding graduate of CBE Ph.D. program who distinguishes him/herself in scholarship, teaching and service. The winner of the Award will be invited to deliver a five-minute talk at the departmental graduation ceremony in May.  

**February**
- My first-authored paper has been published in the *Journal of Chemical Physics*. The title is "Can we define a unique microscopic pressure in inhomogeneous fluids?" [[PDF]](http://kaihangshi.github.io/assets/docs/paper/Shi_JCP_2021.pdf). In this paper, for the first time, we show strong evidence that it is possible to define a unique microscopic pressure, a property that has been considered ambiguous at the nanoscale since 1950.

**January**
- I was accepted as a AAAS member through the *AAAS/Science Program for Excellence in Science*. This program provides me with a one-year membership for AAAS, which includes a free subscription to the digital version of Journal *Science*.

## 2020
**December** 
- I was invited to give a talk on the uniqueness of the microscopic pressure tensor at the [Statistical Mechanics & Molecular Simulations (STMS) Seminar Series](https://sites.google.com/view/stms2021/schedule?authuser=0), hosted by Prof. Amir Haji-Akbari (Yale) and Prof. Sapna Sarupria (Minnesota).

**November**
- I was invited to give a 110-minute guest lecture in the course *Molecular Simulation of Materials* in Civil and Environmental Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University.
- The paper in collaboration with Prof. Carlos Vega's group has been published in *Journal of Chemical Physics*. The title is "The Young–Laplace equation for a solid–liquid interface".
- I gave a pre-recorded talk at the 2020 AIChE Annual Meeting and I had a great time meeting some friends there virtually!

**October**
- I gave a virtual poster on [MOFdb](https://mof.tech.northwestern.edu/) at the 2020 Nanoporous Materials Genome Center (NMGC) All-Hands Meeting.  

**August**
- I joined Prof. Randy Snurr's group at Northwestern University as a postdoc fellow!

**July**
- My first-author paper has been published in *J. Chem. Theory Comput.*. The title is "Microscopic Pressure Tensor in Cylindrical Geometry: Pressure of Water in a Carbon Nanotube".

**May**
- I successfully defended my PhD thesis! 
- The paper in collaboration with Prof. Saad Khan's group has been published in *ACS Appl. Polym. Mater.*. The title is "Designing Intrinsically Microporous Polymer (PIM-1) Microfibers with Tunable Morphology and Porosity via Controlling Solvent/Nonsolvent/Polymer Interactions".

**April**
- Our Reply to the Comment on the microscopic pressure tensor has been published in *Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics*. 

**March**
- The paper in collaboration with Prof. Stefano Menegatti's group has been published in *Journal of Materials Chemistry B*. The title is "Modified gaphene oxide (GO) particles in peptide hydrogels: a hybrid system enabling scheduled delivery of synergistic combinations of chemotherapeutics".

**January**
- My first-author paper has been published in *Langmuir*. The title is "Conformal Sites Theory for Adsorbed Films on Energetically Heterogeneous Surfaces".
- The paper in collaboration with Prof. Gregory Parsons's group has been published in *Journal of Materials Chemistry A*. The title is "Fabrication of a freestanding metal organic framework predominant hollow fiber mat and its potential applications in gas separation and catalysis".
